Okay, all the possible combinations of things are the following.


Guest changes:
    - PV, HVM, PVH
    - Hardware assisted paging (on/off)
    - Taskset within benchmark (on/off)
    - Guest pinning in config file (on/off)

Host changes (will need manual intervention):
    - TIMER_SLOP (default/lower)
    - NULL_SCHEDULER for guests
    - Dom0 pinned to its own cores
    - Hyperthreading (on/off)

Misc:
    - Will need to consider overcommit! Last time I tried it some of the VMs wouldn't even boot
    - 3*2*2*2 = 24 benchmark runs per host change
    - Will probably pin Dom0 to 8 cores? Will have to be 11VM instead of 13VM.
    - Can't do NULL_SCHEDULER at the same time as guest pinning
