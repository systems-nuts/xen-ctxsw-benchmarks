Hi!

The "contextswitch" directory contains the actual contextswitch executables that were executed on
each machine.

The "figs" directory contains every single figure generated from the data. 

The "sample_data" directory contains the data for a single run of the benchmark. The data itself
is compressed in a ZIP. 

The "vm" directory contains the host.py and guest.py scripts used to perform the benchmark.
